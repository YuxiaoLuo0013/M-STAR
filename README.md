We have open the Tecent Data （Beijing） used in this paper, which is processed from https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CoPB. Due to privacy protection regulations, the Shenzhen dataset is currently not publicly available. We are working on exploring appropriate data sharing protocols and will update this repository once access becomes possible in compliance with relevant policies.
